# Chatter_app_minimalistic
This is kind of like my other project (chatter_app) but with more styling added and a minimalistic design. 
This project doesn't use MongoDB and saves all of the users into an array. 
In addition, there are no private messaging or the ability to read your sent messages and you can only see users that are online in the current room. 

The reason for creating this chat app was because I wasn't quite happy with my other project (chatter_app). My code was clunky and not clean at all and I wasn't happy with the 
CSS styling. The project didn't work with every device (should have used flexbox). Also, I didn't quite understand Socket.IO. These were the reasons why I wanted to make a new 
chat app. I now know that there are such methods like socket.join and io.to().emit. Hahaha... Those methods would've saved me so much time in my previous chat app project.

1. Pull my project or download it and extract the contents of the .zip file to a folder

2. Open up the terminal/cmd and in the terminal head over to the project folder.

3. Install required dependencies by typing in 'npm install' (you need to have NodeJS installed).

4. After the dependencies have been installed, type in 'npm run dev', which will start the application.

5. The server should be up and running on port 3000. Head over to localhost:3000 or 127.0.0.1:3000 in your preferred browser.
